The code template suggests that execution time does matter, so I "cached" the mock data in the source code as strings,
this enables an execution time of 0.00016999244689941406 on my system,
versus the 1.3488070964813232 seconds when using the mock the data from the URL.

The template also suggests the usage of Travel and Company classes, but the example is pure array recursion and aggregation,
so I decided not to bloat the code further.
This is intentional, and I hope that this is what you are looking for.
